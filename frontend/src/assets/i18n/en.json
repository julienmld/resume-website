    "studies-description": "\nAfter obtaining my scientific baccalaureate at René Cassin High School in Montfort-sur-Meu, I chose to pursue a two-year preparatory cycle to enter the École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Rennes (ESIR). During these two years, I strengthened my skills in mathematics, logic, and development, particularly with the Java language.\n\nAs planned, I then joined ESIR. The first year was composed of a core curriculum including subjects such as mathematics and development, regardless of the school's offered specializations. In the second year, I focused on the Internet of Things (IoT), which allowed me to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, the React framework, and embedded systems. To illustrate my learning of React, below is a video of the project I developed that year: a chat application for users, integrating features such as login and group creation. This video was used to demonstrate the proper functioning of the application to my teachers.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the pandemic, my second-year internship in Spain could not take place. I continued my academic journey at ESIR. In my final year, I worked on an industrial project with the Rennes-based startup Image ET, which aimed to design a prototype to protect medical staff from hazardous radiation. A video of this prototype is also available below. The project involved detecting when a person entered a radiation-emitting area, stopping the emission, and resuming it once the area was safe. This simple prototype allowed me to work with an Arduino board with various sensors and a Raspberry Pi to track the state changes.\n\nFinally, I completed my final-year internship at Sopra Steria, which led to a permanent job offer. I received my diploma that same year.",

    "sopra-description": "\nI started my career at Sopra Steria with a final-year internship in the CRACN team (Components and Hosting of Licorn Configurations). This team, composed of about twenty people, welcomed me as a full-stack developer. The site I worked on was entirely dedicated to defense projects, with the main clients being the DGA (French Defense Procurement Agency) and the DIRISI (Inter-army Infrastructure and Information Systems Network Directorate). Due to the sensitivity of this sector, I cannot go into the functional details of the applications, but I would be happy to share more during a meeting.\n\nDuring my internship, I developed features and fixed bugs on both the backend (Java) and frontend (Angular). I had the opportunity to work on a complex and old project while contributing to process industrialization with Jenkins.\n\nAfter signing my permanent contract, I continued in this team for more than two years, where I evolved to become a technical lead or \"tech leader,\" as we call it at Sopra Steria.\n\nTowards the end of 2023, I felt the need to take on new challenges as my learning curve started to flatten. I decided to focus more on DevOps and joined the SPRINT (Secure Portal Registered over INTernet) project. This project was significantly different from CRACN due to its microservices architecture. It allowed me to deepen my knowledge of Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes (Docker), while solidifying my skills in Java and Angular.\n\nIn 2024, in addition to my work on SPRINT, I mentored several colleagues, contributing to the estimation of large-scale solutions and supporting younger team members in their tasks. I also mentored an intern and an apprentice. The SPRINT project concluded at the end of 2024 with a production release, shortly before my resignation. I then briefly participated in a third project, where I mainly assisted a team of two junior developers in updating the software stack of the application.",

I mainly used two tools: Jenkins and GitLab. These allowed me, on the two major projects I worked on, to set up continuous integration pipelines. These pipelines were essential for automating the installation and testing of our applications, whether through integration tests (checking REST requests) or UI tests via the Cypress software. Over time, I learned the importance, even the necessity, of these pipelines, which not only enable regression testing but also save a considerable amount of time for the team.\n\nOn my second project at Sopra Steria, SPRINT, the DevOps aspect was particularly prominent. I discovered and used technologies such as Terraform (for infrastructure as code) and Ansible (for configuration automation). I also worked on Kubernetes, using Helm as a package manager.\n\nWithin Kubernetes, I implemented several key features, including backing up the SPRINT application via the Velero tool and autoscaling this application, allowing resources to automatically adjust based on load.",
